  iBridge Camp is back again! This camp is an opportunity for Christian young working adults from diverse backgrounds and denominations to encourage, fellowship, share, and learn from one another.
  
  Everyone wants to feel passionate about their job, but passion and pay do not always go hand in hand. The trick for many of us is to figure out how to balance the love for our jobs versus putting food on the table. Can both intersect, or must we always sacrifice one for the other?
  
  During these four days, we will have speakers who will share their challenges, experiences, and joy in living their lives; sessions that will make us rethink about our life and how we can improve our current way of living, and of course - making new friends !

  ## Location
  
  A place to unwind, relax and enjoy the beauty and sounds of nature. There are times where one just has to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. What better place than Outbac Broga which is nestled among the beauty of nature with lush greeneries and a flowing stream. The serenity of the sanctuary will immediately envelope you with a sense of relaxation and peace. Just the right place to recharge.
